# xsioux
Apple Music playlist JSON data converter

Downloads a JSON array of objects with the following properties:
1. Song title
2. Artist name
3. Album name

Instructions:
1. Go to [Apple Music](https://music.apple.com)
2. Navigate to the playlist page you want to save
3. paste xsioux.js into the console

I know it's not the most elegant solution but it's easier than using Apple's boujee API.
